# Overview #

The microarray data analysis realm is ever growing through the development of various tools, open source and commercial. However there is absence of predefined rational algorithmic analysis workflows or batch standardized processing to incorporate all steps, from raw data import up to the derivation of significantly differentially expressed gene lists. This absence obfuscates the analytical procedure and obstructs the massive comparative processing of genomic microarray datasets. Moreover, the solutions provided, heavily depend on the programming skills of the user, whereas in the case of GUI embedded solutions, they do not provide direct support of various raw image analysis formats or a versatile and simultaneously flexible combination of signal processing methods.

Gene ARMADA (Automated Robust MicroArray Data Analysis) is a MATLAB implemented platform with a GUI. This suite integrates all steps of microarray data analysis including automated data import, noise correction and filtering, normalization, statistical selection of differentially expressed genes, clustering, classification and annotation. In its current version, Gene ARMADA fully supports 2 coloured cDNA arrays, Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays, Agilent 1-channel arrays plus custom arrays for which experimental details are given in tabular form (Excel spreadsheet, comma separated values, tab-delimited text formats). It also supports the analysis of already processed results through its versatile import editor. Besides being fully automated, Gene ARMADA incorporates numerous functionalities of the Statistics and Bioinformatics Toolboxes of MATLAB. In addition, it provides numerous visualization and exploration tools plus customizable export data formats for seamless integration by other analysis tools or MATLAB, for further processing.

Gene ARMADA provides a highly adaptable, integrative, yet flexible tool which can be used for automated quality control, analysis, annotation and visualization of microarray data, constituting a starting point for further data interpretation and integration with numerous other tools.

## Latest news ##

## version 2.3.6 ##
### Major updates ###
  * Fixed a bug in probe summarization that caused non-reproducible results under circumstances.
  * Fixed a bug that allowed Analysis objects with non-normalized data to be included in the list of Analyses to be subjected to statistical analysis, causing a crash under circumstances.
### Minor updates ###
  * Added additional information in the Analysis report, containing information about the probe summarization method.
  * Fixed proper display of program version.
  * A reperformed statistical analysis with no results is now an empty list instead of keeping the previous result.
## version 2.3.5 ##
### Major updates ###
  * Added the option to perform kNN missing value imputation in the gene space instead of only the sample space (imputation distance calculated also on rows instead of only columns of the data matrix).
## version 2.3.4 ##
### Minor updates ###
  * Fixed a bug in Fuzzy C-means clustering that prevented the export of clustering results when clustering replicates
## version 2.3.3 ##
### Major updates ###
  * Added the ability to choose the type of defining final poor spots in 2-channel arrays: common poor spots from both channels (default) or the union of poor spots from any channel
  * Updated the Batch Programmer to support the above change
